this is a far in the course I have felt that I have really learned the format of what I am supposed to do. In other HTML and CSS classes I was just copying what was going down. I feel that I am understanding what everything actually does. I do think that I could use some help on the short cuts and feel that sometimes we move quick in class. I do like the ICA's becuase they allow for me to learn and grow. They also thus far have been able to build on each other which has alloed me to learn.
