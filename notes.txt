So far in this course, I feel like I've truly learned the structure and purpose of what I’m doing. In previous HTML and CSS classes, I was just copying what was being taught without fully understanding it. Now, I feel like I actually understand how everything works. That said, I think I could benefit from learning more shortcuts, and at times, the pace of the class feels a bit fast. I really enjoy the ICAs because they give me an opportunity to learn and grow. They’ve also been designed to build on each other, which has really helped me develop my skills.
